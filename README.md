The script is designed to act as a backend service that monitors a bridge contract on a source blockchain, processes lock events, and triggers corresponding token release actions on a destination blockchain.\n\nThis project serves as a demonstration, showcasing a structured, multi-class architecture for building resilient blockchain services in Python.\n\n## Concept\n\nA cross-chain bridge allows users to transfer assets or data from one blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) to another (e.g., Polygon). A common mechanism for asset transfer is the \"lock-and-mint\" model:\n\n1.  **Lock**: A user sends tokens to a smart contract on the source chain. The contract locks these tokens and emits an event (`TokensLocked`) containing details of the transaction (user, amount, token, etc.). The event might look like this in the contract's code:\n\n    ```solidity\n    // Example event structure in the source bridge contract\n    event TokensLocked(\n        address indexed user,\n        address indexed token,\n        uint256 amount,\n        bytes32 indexed destinationTxHash // A unique ID for the cross-chain transaction\n    );\n    ```\n\n2.  **Verify**: Off-chain services, called validators or listeners, monitor the source chain for these `TokensLocked` events.\n3.  **Mint/Release**: After verifying the event, the service triggers a function on a corresponding smart contract on the destination chain. This function mints or releases an equivalent amount of pegged tokens to the intended recipient.\n\nThis script simulates the critical **Validator/Listener** component (steps 2 and 3).\n\n## Code Architecture\n\nThe script is designed with a clear separation of concerns, organized into several key classes:\n\n-   `BlockchainConnector`: Responsible for establishing and maintaining a connection to a blockchain's JSON-RPC endpoint using the `web3.py` library. It handles connection retries and provides basic functions like fetching the latest block number.\n\n-   `TransactionManager`: Encapsulates the logic for creating, signing, and submitting transactions to the destination chain. It manages the validator's account and interacts with the destination bridge contract. In this simulation, it logs transaction details instead of broadcasting them.\n\n-   `EventProcessor`: Contains the core business logic. It takes raw event logs from the source chain, validates their data, ensures they have not been processed before, and instructs the `TransactionManager` to perform the corresponding action on the destination chain.\n\n-   `BridgeListener`: The main orchestrator class. It initializes all other components, manages the main application state (like the last processed block), and runs the primary polling loop that continuously checks for new events.\n\n-   `CONFIG`: A dictionary that centralizes all configuration parameters, such as RPC URLs, contract addresses, and polling intervals. This makes the system easy to configure and adapt.\n\n### Data Flow Diagram\n\n```\n(Source Chain)      (BridgeListener Script)\n     |                     |\n[Bridge Contract]          |\n     | emits               |\n     | 'TokensLocked'      |\n     | event               |     +-----------------------+\n     +-------------------> |     |  BridgeListener       |\n                           |     | (Main Loop)           |\n                           |     +-----------+-----------+\n                           |                 | polls\n                           |     +-----------v-----------+\n                           |     | BlockchainConnector   |\n                           |     | (Fetches Events)      |\n                           |     +-----------+-----------+\n                           |                 | passes events\n                           |     +-----------v-----------+\n                           |     |  EventProcessor       | --> (Validates, checks for duplicates)\n                           |     | (Business Logic)      |\n                           |     +-----------+-----------+\n                           |                 | triggers action\n                           |     +-----------v-----------+\n                           |     | TransactionManager    | --(simulated)--> (Destination Chain)\n                           |     | (Signs & Sends Tx)    |\n                           |     +-----------------------+\n```\n\n## How it Works\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The `BridgeListener` class is instantiated. It sets up two `BlockchainConnector` instancesâ€”one for the source chain and one for the destination chain.\n2.  **State Management**: It determines a starting block to scan for events. In this simulation, it starts a few blocks behind the current chain tip. In a real-world scenario, this state would be persisted in a database to ensure no events are missed between restarts.\n3.  **Polling Loop**: The `run()` method starts an infinite loop.\n4.  **Fetch Blocks**: In each iteration, it queries the `BlockchainConnector` for the latest block number on the source chain.\n5.  **Define Range**: It calculates a block range to scan (`from_block` to `to_block`), ensuring it leaves a buffer of several blocks (`confirmations_required`) from the chain tip. This is a crucial step to avoid processing events from blocks that might be reverted in a chain reorganization (reorg).\n6.  **Filter Events**: It uses `web3.py`'s event filtering to query the source bridge contract for any `TokensLocked` events within the calculated block range.\n7.  **Process Events**: If events are found, they are passed to the `EventProcessor`.\n8.  **Validate and Trigger Action**: The `EventProcessor` validates each event's data, checks a local cache to prevent double-processing, and then calls the `TransactionManager` to prepare and sign the `releaseTokens` transaction for the destination chain.\n9.  **Simulate Submission**: The `TransactionManager` builds and signs the transaction but, for safety in this demonstration, only logs the details of what *would* have been sent to the network.\n10. **Update State**: After successfully scanning a range, the `BridgeListener` updates its `last_processed_block` tracker and waits for the configured polling interval before starting the next cycle.\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\n-   Python 3.8+\n-   `pip` package manager\n\n### 2. Installation\n\nClone the repository and install the required dependencies:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the repository directory\ncd {repo_name}\n\n# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n\n# Install libraries\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 3. Configuration\n\nBefore running, open `script.py` and modify the `CONFIG` dictionary to match your setup. You must provide valid RPC URLs, contract addresses, and a private key for the validator account. Replace placeholder values like `'0xSourceBridgeContractAddress...'` with your actual contract addresses.\n\n```python\nCONFIG = {\n    'source_chain': {\n        'name': 'Ethereum-Sepolia',\n        'rpc_url': 'https://rpc.sepolia.org',\n        'bridge_contract_address': '0xSourceBridgeContractAddress...',\n    },\n    'destination_chain': {\n        'name': 'Polygon-Mumbai',\n        'rpc_url': 'https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com',\n        'bridge_contract_address': '0xDestinationBridgeContractAddress...',\n        'chain_id': 80001,\n    },\n    'validator': {\n        # IMPORTANT: Never commit private keys directly. Use environment variables\n        # or a secure secret manager in a production environment.\n        'private_key': '0xYOUR_VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE',\n    },\n    'listener_settings': {\n        'poll_interval_seconds': 15,\n        'confirmations_required': 6, # Blocks to wait before processing an event\n        'initial_scan_backlog_blocks': 100,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Entry Point\n\nThe script is executed via the standard `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, which initializes and runs the listener.\n\n```python\n# In script.py\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        listener = BridgeListener(config=CONFIG)\n        listener.run()\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"\\nShutting down listener gracefully...\")\n```\n\n### 5. Running the Script\n\nExecute the script from your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython script.py\n```\n\nThe script will start running and logging its activity to both the console and the `bridge_listener.log` file.\n\n### Example Output\n\n```\n2023-10-27 10:30:00,123 - __main__ - INFO - Initializing Cross-Chain Bridge Listener...\n2023-10-27 10:30:02,456 - __main__ - INFO - Successfully connected to Ethereum-Sepolia at https://rpc.sepolia.org\n2023-10-27 10:30:04,789 - __main__ - INFO - Successfully connected to Polygon-Mumbai at https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com\n2023-10-27 10:30:05,111 - __main__ - INFO - Setting initial start block to 4500100\n2023-10-27 10:30:05,112 - __main__ - INFO - Starting event listening loop.
